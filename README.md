# Simple-Auth-API
A lightweight ASP.NET Core Web API demonstrating basic authentication and route protection using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).  
This project uses static in-memory data for user management.
Implemented basic `Register` and `Login` functionality, and protected specific endpoints using the `[Authorize]` attribute to demonstrate simple role-based and authenticated access control.
